# SchoolDay

Show the daily school schedule (so I don't have to ask my child each and every day - what courses do you have today). Lots of assumptions here about different types of schools days and 4/3 blocks.

My first Swift project after a long absence from iOS (Objective-C).

## Third-Party Code

Just using [UPCarouselFlowLayout](https://github.com/ink-spot/UPCarouselFlowLayout) for now.  Copied the one and only source file directly in, rather than adding CocoaPods requirement.
